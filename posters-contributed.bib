	title = {Real-time {fMRI} neurofeedback improves finger tapping precision: A feasibility study to improve fine motor skills in movement disorders},
	url = {https://rtfin2022.squarespace.com/poster-session-1},
	abstract = {Background \& Rationale: Motor imagery can be used to improve overt movement. Realtime {fMRI} ({rtfMRI}) neurofeedback can be used to guide individuals towards activating
brain regions of interest, such as motor regions affected by neurologic insult, which could
potentially improve overt motor performance. As such, {rtfMRI} neurofeedback training is a
promising avenue for motor rehabilitation those with movement disorders, including
individuals with impaired fine motor skills that impact daily activities and quality of life.
Methods: Seventeen right-handed, healthy adults (8 females, mean age = 23 years)
completed a motor imagery-based {rtfMRI} neurofeedback paradigm. Run 1: Participants
were asked to use their right index finger to tap in sync with a visual cue of a crosshair
that flashed at 1, 2, 3, or 4 Hz. A slider bar indicated whether people tapped too fast or
slow based on the recorded button presses. Given the {fMRI} data, a support vector
machine ({SVM}) model was trained to extract motor patterns of tapping vs rest using
3dsvm [{LaConte} 2005] within {AFNI}’s real-time engine [Cox, 1995]. Run 1 also provided
a baseline measure of motor performance. Run 2: participants imagined themselves
tapping (i.e., motor imagery) during {rtfMRI}. Visual neurofeedback, presented as the same
slider bar, was provided every 2 seconds based on the real-time {fMRI} data of motor
imagery and the {SVM} brain patterns associated with overt tapping in Run 1. Run 3:
Participants completed another round of overt finger tapping, identical to Run 1. Tapping
accuracy (root mean squared error, {RMSE}) measured the difference between actual and
target speed. {RMSE} was compared between Run 3 minus Run 1 to evaluate
improvement as a function of rt-{fMRI} neurofeedback in Run 2.
Results: Motor regions that were activated in Run 2 during motor imagery (relative to
rest) correlated with a reduction in errors. This was most apparent at 4 Hz. The bilateral
primary motor cortex (M1), right premotor cortex, and supplementary motor area ({SMA})
showed associations between motor imagery and tapping accuracy improvements. 
Conclusions: This study demonstrates the feasibility of using {rtfMRI} neurofeedback with
motor imagery to improve fine motor skills and precision in clinical populations for whom
such overt movement is difficult.},
