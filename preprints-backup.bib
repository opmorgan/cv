	abstract = {Consciousness is not explained by a single mechanism, rather it involves multiple specialized neural systems overlapping in space and time. We hypothesize that synergistic, large-scale subcortical and cortical attention and signal processing networks encode conscious experiences. To identify brain activity in conscious perception without overt report, we classified visual stimuli as perceived or not using eye measurements. Report-independent event-related potentials and functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) signals both occurred at early times after stimuli. Direct recordings revealed a novel thalamic awareness potential linked to conscious visual perception based on report. {fMRI} showed thalamic and cortical detection, arousal, attentional salience, task-positive, and default mode networks were involved independent of overt report. These findings identify a specific sequence of neural mechanisms in human conscious visual perception.One-Sentence Summary Human conscious visual perception engages large-scale subcortical and cortical networks even without overt report.Competing Interest {StatementThe} authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne infectious disease in the United States. Post-treatment Lyme disease ({PTLD}) is a condition affecting 10-20\% of patients in which symptoms persist despite antibiotic treatment. Cognitive complaints are common among those with {PTLD}, suggesting that brain changes are associated with the course of the illness. However, there has been a paucity of evidence to explain the cognitive difficulties expressed by patients with {PTLD}.
          This study administered a working memory task to a carefully screened group of 12 patients with well-characterized {PTLD} and 18 healthy controls while undergoing functional {MRI} ({fMRI}). A subset of 12 controls and all 12 {PTLD} participants also received diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI}) to measure white matter integrity. Clinical variables were also assessed and correlated with these multimodal {MRI} findings.
          On the working memory task, the patients with {PTLD} responded more slowly, but no less accurately, than did controls. {FMRI} activations were observed in expected regions by the controls, and to a lesser extent, by the {PTLD} participants. The {PTLD} group also hypoactivated several regions relevant to the task. Conversely, novel regions were activated by the {PTLD} group that were not observed in controls, suggesting a compensatory mechanism. Notably, three activations were located in white matter of the frontal lobe. {DTI} measures applied to these three regions of interest revealed that higher axial diffusivity correlated with fewer cognitive and neurological symptoms. Whole-brain {DTI} analyses revealed several frontal lobe regions in which higher axial diffusivity in the patients with {PTLD} correlated with longer duration of illness. Together, these results show that the brain is altered by {PTLD}, involving changes to white matter within the frontal lobe. Higher axial diffusivity may reflect white matter repair and healing over time, rather than pathology, and cognition appears to be dynamically affected throughout this repair process.},
